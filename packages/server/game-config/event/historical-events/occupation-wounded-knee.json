    "text": "In February 1973, members of the American Indian Movement (AIM) and Oglala Lakota activists took control of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. They were protesting corruption in the local tribal government led by Richard Wilson and broader issues affecting Indigenous people, including broken treaties and federal neglect. The occupation began on February 27 and drew national attention, highlighting long-standing grievances. U.S. Marshals and FBI agents surrounded the area, leading to a 71-day standoff that became a pivotal moment in the Native American civil rights movement.",
