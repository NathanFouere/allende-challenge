    "text": "In September 1973, Juan Perón was elected President of Argentina in a historic landslide victory, marking his return to power after 18 years in exile. Running as the candidate of the Peronist Justicialist Liberation Front, Perón secured over 60% of the vote, reflecting widespread support across social classes. His election followed months of political turmoil and the resignation of interim President Héctor Cámpora. Shortly after taking office, Perón moved swiftly to ban the leftist guerrilla group Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo (ERP), signaling his intent to crack down on violent insurgencies and restore order. While many hope his leadership will bring stability, tensions between leftist and rightist factions within the Peronist movement, along with the ongoing economic struggles, make Argentina's future under Perón both hopeful and uncertain.",
