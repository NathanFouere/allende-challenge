  "text": "On January 30, 1972, a tragic event known as Bloody Sunday unfolded in Derry, Northern Ireland, when British soldiers opened fire on unarmed civil rights protesters. The marchers were demonstrating against the policy of internment without trial, which had been imposed on the nationalist community. As the protest progressed, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment shot 26 civilians, killing 13 instantly, with another dying later from injuries. The incident shocked the world, escalating tensions in Northern Ireland and leading to widespread condemnation. Bloody Sunday intensified the conflict known as the Troubles, deepening the divide between the Catholic nationalist and Protestant unionist communities, and leaving a lasting scar on the history of Northern Ireland.",
