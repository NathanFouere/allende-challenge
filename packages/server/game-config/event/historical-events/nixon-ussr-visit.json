    "text": "The Moscow Summit of 1972, held from May 22 to May 30, marked a significant moment in Cold War diplomacy between the United States and the Soviet Union. President Richard Nixon and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev met in Moscow, leading to historic agreements that advanced the policy of d√©tente. Among the key outcomes were the signing of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I), both aimed at controlling nuclear arms and reducing the risk of conflict. Another notable achievement was the Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Environmental Protection and the signing of a pact that paved the way for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, symbolizing a rare moment of collaboration between the two superpowers in space exploration. This summit, following Nixon's landmark visit to China earlier that year, solidified the United States' efforts to ease tensions with both communist powers and marked a turning point in U.S.-Soviet relations.",
