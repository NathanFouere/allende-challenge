  "title": "Signature of the seabed denaculerasation treaty",
  "text": "On February 11, 1971, over forty nations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, took a significant step towards global security by signing a treaty that bans the placement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and ocean floor. This agreement, signed in Moscow, London, and Washington, is the result of years of delicate negotiations within the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament. While the treaty is a positive move towards curbing the arms race, it is telling that France and China have chosen not to sign, highlighting the complex and unresolved tensions between these powers and the broader international community regarding disarmament efforts.",
