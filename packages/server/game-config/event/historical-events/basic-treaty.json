    "text": "The Basic Treaty, signed on December 21, 1972, between West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR), marked a significant step in normalizing relations between the two German states without full legal recognition. The treaty, a product of Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik, was part of broader East-West d√©tente during the Cold War. While the treaty acknowledged the borders established after World War II and promoted peaceful coexistence, it maintained West Germany's long-term goal of reunification. The treaty facilitated cooperation in various areas while preserving legal distinctions, as the FRG did not view the GDR as a foreign state.",
