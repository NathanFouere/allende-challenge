  "text": "On March 29, 1973, the last American combat troops left Vietnam, marking the end of direct U.S. military involvement in the conflict. The date is significant as it concluded a chapter in a war that had deeply divided the United States and left a profound impact on both the Vietnamese and American people. Simultaneously, Hanoi released the final group of its acknowledged U.S. prisoners of war. As the American forces departed, the situation in Vietnam remained uncertain, with the conflict between the North and South far from resolved. This withdrawal highlighted the beginning of a new phase in the war, one where the fate of Vietnam would rest more heavily on the South Vietnamese forces and their continued struggle against the North Vietnamese. The legacy of this conflict, and the eventual reunification of Vietnam, would continue to shape the region and international relations for years to come.",
