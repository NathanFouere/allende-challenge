    "text": "In September 1971, the Four Power Agreement on Berlin marked a crucial turning point in Cold War diplomacy, reaffirming the post-1945 rights and responsibilities of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union over Berlin and Germany. By improving travel and communication between East and West Berlin and enhancing the lives of residents in the Western Sectors, the agreement helped reduce tensions and laid the groundwork for DÃ©tente. Although the ultimate status of Berlin was left deliberately vague to maintain each side's legal positions, the agreement played a key role in re-establishing ties between East and West Berlin, contributing to the eventual process of German reunification.",
