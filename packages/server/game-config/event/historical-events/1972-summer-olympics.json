  "text": "The 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich opened with lingering memories of the 1936 Berlin Games, where the event had been used as a tool of propaganda under the Nazi regime. Munich aimed to distance itself from that dark past, presenting a vision of peace and international cooperation. However, the historical echoes of 1936 were hard to ignore, as athletes from around the world gathered once again on German soil, this time with hopes that the Games could symbolize unity and healing after the devastation of World War II.",
