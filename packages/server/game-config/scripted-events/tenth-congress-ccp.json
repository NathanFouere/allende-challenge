  "text": "The 10th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party took place from August 24 to 28, 1973, against the backdrop of the ongoing Cultural Revolution and the aftermath of Lin Biao’s fall from grace. With 1,249 delegates representing 28 million members, the congress was a key moment for the CCP, as it aimed to restructure leadership and reaffirm the party’s direction. The suspension of Lin Biao and his associates was officially confirmed, and Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai opened the session, calling for the rehabilitation of several sidelined old guard members. The revised party constitution, which removed Lin Biao’s influence, was approved, maintaining the ideological foundations laid during the 9th Congress.\\n\\nThe congress also elected 195 new Central Committee members, with the radical Gang of Four securing significant positions, including Wang Hongwen as the party’s second vice-chairman. In his speech, Wang emphasized the defeat of the \"bourgeois headquarters\" led by Liu Shaoqi and Lin Biao, stressing the importance of ongoing revolution and youth leadership. With Mao’s backing, the congress solidified the continuation of the Cultural Revolution, ensuring that China’s political future would remain focused on radical transformation.",
