    "text": "On March 26, 1971, the people of East Pakistan declared their independence, naming their new nation Bangladesh. This bold move came after years of escalating tensions and systematic discrimination by the central government of Pakistan, which had culminated in a brutal military crackdown. In response to the declaration, Pakistan's military forces have launched a full-scale invasion, deploying troops in an attempt to crush the independence movement with ruthless force. The newly proclaimed Bangladesh now faces an overwhelming challenge, as it fights for its very survival against the formidable military power of Pakistan. Reports of atrocities and a rapidly escalating humanitarian crisis are beginning to reach the outside world, drawing international attention to the unfolding tragedy.",
