    "text": "In June 1971, the Soyuz 11 mission made history as the only crewed mission to board the worldâ€™s first space station, Salyut 1. On June 7, astronauts Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev successfully docked with the space station, marking a significant achievement for Soviet space exploration. Their mission demonstrated the feasibility of long-duration human spaceflight and advanced scientific research in orbit. However, tragedy struck on June 29, when the crew capsule depressurized during preparations for re-entry, resulting in the deaths of all three astronauts. This disaster underscored the inherent risks of space travel and led to significant design changes in future Soviet spacecraft to ensure the safety of cosmonauts. The loss of the Soyuz 11 crew remains a somber reminder of the challenges faced in the pursuit of space exploration.",
