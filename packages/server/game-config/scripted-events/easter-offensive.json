    "text": "The Easter Offensive, launched by North Vietnam on March 30, 1972, was a massive military campaign during the Vietnam War, marking a significant escalation in the conflict. This offensive, the largest since the Korean War, saw North Vietnamese forces launching coordinated assaults on three fronts against South Vietnam’s ARVN and U.S. forces.\n\n The North’s goal was to achieve a decisive military victory that would strengthen its position in the ongoing Paris Peace Accords.  North Vietnamese troops, supported by heavy artillery and armored units, quickly overran key positions in the I Corps Tactical Zone, capturing Quảng Trị and threatening Huế. In the II Corps Zone, they advanced towards Kon Tum, aiming to split South Vietnam in two. Meanwhile, in the III Corps Zone, they captured Lộc Ninh and advanced toward An Lộc, just north of Saigon. The initial success of the offensive caught the defenders off guard, but by May, the South Vietnamese forces, bolstered by U.S. airpower, began counterattacks.\n\nBy September, South Vietnam had recaptured Quảng Trị, marking a turning point in the campaign.  While the offensive ultimately failed to secure major territorial gains for North Vietnam, it inflicted heavy casualties and strengthened their bargaining position in peace negotiations. The U.S. responded with Operation Linebacker, resuming heavy bombing of North Vietnam, further intensifying the war.",
