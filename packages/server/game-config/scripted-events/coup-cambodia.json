  "title": "Marshall Lon Nol Coup in Cambodia",
  "text": "On March 10, 1972, Marshal Lon Nol solidified his control over Cambodia by formally assuming the presidency of the Khmer Republic. Having already deposed Prince Norodom Sihanouk in 1970, Lon Nol's rise to power marked a significant shift in Cambodiaâ€™s political landscape. His government sought to align more closely with the West during the Vietnam War, positioning itself against the growing influence of communism in the region. However, his regime faced increasing internal dissent and mounting pressure from the Khmer Rouge insurgency. Lon Nol's leadership, while initially bolstered by American support, would soon struggle to maintain stability as Cambodia descended deeper into conflict.",
