    "text": "The 1972 U.S. Presidential Election took place on November 7, 1972, and saw incumbent Republican President Richard Nixon secure a decisive victory over Democratic candidate George McGovern, winning by a margin of 23.2 points—the fourth-largest in U.S. history. The election occurred amid the backdrop of the Vietnam War, negotiations on strategic arms limitation (including the signing of the ABM Treaty), and Nixon's policy of détente with China and the Soviet Union. McGovern, running on an anti-war platform, faced internal divisions within his party and was further weakened by the scandal surrounding his initial vice-presidential candidate, Thomas Eagleton.",
