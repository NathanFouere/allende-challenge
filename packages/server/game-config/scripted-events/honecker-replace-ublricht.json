    "text": "On May 3, 1971, Walter Ulbricht stepped down as the First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) in East Germany, marking the end of an era for the country’s leadership. He was succeeded by Erich Honecker, who was unanimously elected to the position. Ulbricht, who cited his advanced age and the need for younger leadership as reasons for his resignation, will continue to hold the title of Chairman of the State Council, effectively remaining head of state. Honecker's rise to power signals a continuation of the firm policies established under Ulbricht, with no indication of a softening stance toward the West. In his inaugural address, Honecker emphasized the importance of maintaining a policy of firmness and security, reaffirming East Germany's commitment to the Soviet Union and the broader communist movement. Despite Ulbricht’s departure, the change in leadership is expected to have little impact on East Germany’s rigid approach, as Honecker has been managing key political matters for some time.",
