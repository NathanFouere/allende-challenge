  "title": "Agreement for the withdrayl of the Fedayins from southern Lebanon",
  "text": "The agreement between Lebanese authorities and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on October 3, 1972, addressed the withdrawal of fedayeen, Palestinian fighters, from towns and villages in southern Lebanon. This agreement followed a period of escalating tensions between Palestinian forces, who used Lebanon as a base for operations against Israel, and the Lebanese authorities.\n\nThe presence of the fedayeen in southern Lebanon had caused political and security instability. Israel often responded to Palestinian incursions with retaliatory strikes on Lebanese villages, affecting civilians and the country's overall stability. The Lebanese army, eager to restore its authority in these areas, negotiated with the PLO to limit the military presence of the fedayeen in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe October 3, 1972, agreement stipulated the withdrawal of Palestinian forces from certain areas in the south, particularly towns and villages, in order to reduce tensions with Israel and allow the Lebanese authorities to regain control of these regions.",
