    "text": "In November 1971, the Vietnamization policy continued to unfold, with the United States gradually withdrawing its troops and shifting responsibility to the South Vietnamese forces. The goal was to enable South Vietnam to defend itself against the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, as American involvement in combat steadily declined. While U.S. troops were being sent home and South Vietnamese forces took on a greater role, there were lingering doubts about the effectiveness of this strategy. Questions remained about whether South Vietnam could sustain the fight on its own, and whether this approach would lead to a successful end to the war or merely prolong the conflict.",
